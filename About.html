		<p> I am a passionate final year product design student with strong interest in communicating my ideas through sketches and prototypes. Three years at award winning university, Nottingham Trent University, have allowed me to develop other skills like Solidworks, Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, InDesign, Illustrator, KeyShot and AutoCAD. Meanwhile, I am very hungry for knowledge, thus, I have been self-learning Web Design- HTML 5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3 and GitHub. </p> <br> <p>I am currently interested in  jobs that can challenge my idea thinking skills and provide an international platform to showcast my ideas; ranging from design, marketing, sales and management roles. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information. Thank you. </p>
