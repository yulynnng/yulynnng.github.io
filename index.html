		<p> Hi! I am a final year BA(HONS) Product Design student from Nottingham Trent University seeking for a permanent role from June 2018.  </p> 
		</br> Besides exploring product designing, I have also picked up a very strong interest in front end web designing during my free time. Therefore, I have personally designed and wrote this portfolio to demonstrate my skills in this area.
